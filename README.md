## Summary
Welcome to ROXI, an open source server emulator built with LSB for FFXI.  
ROXI plans to be a highly custom server influenced by Ragnarok Online.  
Get around quickly, level quickly, skill up quickly. Deal more damage, hit faster and summon your own bosses to fight.  
Custom NPCs are people, not mobs. While we do want additional services (ie. warping) but lets not break the esthetic.

:x: EXP Modifier 4x (up to 10x in group play)  
:x: Disabled EXP rings  
:x: Skill up Modifier 10x  
:x: Merits increased cap   
:x: Crafting Skill ups 3x  
:x: Subjobs level to 40
